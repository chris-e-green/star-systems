# star-systems
Traveller star systems generator in swift, Mac console app

Generates a PDF version of a Traveller subsector with optional generation of each individual sector 
(using both book 3 and book 6 rules, plus options for alternative world generation algorithms).

A work-in-progress that was largely about learning Swift (so some parts are more sophisticated than others, 
and some bits experiment with aspects of Swift).

The Traveller game in all forms is owned by Far Future Enterprises. Copyright 1977 - 2008 Far Future Enterprises.
