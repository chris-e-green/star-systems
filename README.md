# star-systems
Traveller star systems generator in swift, Mac console app

Generates a PDF version of a Traveller subsector with optional generation of each individual sector 
(using both book 3 and book 6 rules, plus options for alternative world generation algorithms).

A work-in-progress that was largely about learning Swift (so some parts are more sophisticated than others, 
and some bits experiment with aspects of Swift).
