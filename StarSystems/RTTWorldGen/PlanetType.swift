        case Acheronian: return "These are worlds that were directly affected by their primary's transition from the main sequence; the atmosphere and oceans have been boiled away, leaving a scorched, dead planet."
        case Arean: return "These are worlds with little liquid, that move through a slow geological cycle of a gradual build-up, a short wet and clement period, and a long decline."
        case Arid: return "These are worlds with limited amounts of surface liquid, that maintain an equilibrium with the help of their tectonic activity and their biosphere."
        case Asphodelian: return "These are worlds that were directly affected by their primary's transition from the main sequence; their atmosphere has been boiled away, leaving the surface exposed."
        case Chthonian: return "These are worlds that were directly affected by their primary's transition from the main sequence, or that have simply spent too long in a tight epistellar orbit; their atmospheres have been stripped away."
        case Hebean: return "These are highly active worlds, due to tidal flexing, but with some regions of stability; the larger ones may be able to maintain some atmosphere and surface liquid."
        case Helian: return "These are typical helian or \"subgiant\" worlds â€“ large enough to retain helium atmospheres."
        case JaniLithic: return "These worlds, tide-locked to the primary, are rocky, dry, and geologically active."
        case Jovian: return "These are huge worlds with helium-hydrogen envelopes and compressed cores; the largest emit more heat than they absorb."
        case Meltball: return "These are dwarfs with molten or semi-molten surfaces, either from extreme tidal flexing, or extreme approach to a star."
        case Oceanic: return "These are worlds with a continuous hydrological cycle and deep oceans, due to either dense greenhouse atmosphere or active plate tectonics."
        case Panthalassic: return "These are massive worlds, aborted gas giants, largely composed of water and hydrogen."
        case Promethean: return "These are worlds that, through tidal-flexing, have a geological cycle similar to plate tectonics, that supports surface liquid and atmosphere."
        case Rockball: return "These are mostly dormant worlds, with surfaces largely unchanged since the early period of planetary formation."
        case SmallBody: return "These are bodies too small to sustain hydrostatic equilibrium; nearly all asteroids and comets are small bodies."
        case Snowball: return "These worlds are composed of mostly ice and some rock. They may have varying degrees of activity, ranging from completely cold and still to cryo-volcanically active with extensive subsurface oceans."
        case Stygian: return "These are worlds that were directly affected by their primary's transition from the main sequence; they are melted and blasted lumps."
        case Tectonic: return "These are worlds with active plate tectonics and large bodies of surface liquid, allowing for stable atmospheres and a high likelihood of life."
        case Telluric: return "These are worlds with geoactivity but no hydrological cycle at all, leading to dense runaway-greenhouse atmospheres."
        case Vesperian: return "These worlds are tide-locked to their primary, but at a distance that permits surface liquid and the development of life."
